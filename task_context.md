# Task: MediInsight MVP - AI-Powered Medical Document Analysis Platform

## Quick Status

Current: Unit 1 - Firebase Project Setup & Authentication [STATUS: Ready]
Progress: 0/15 units (0% complete)
Blockers: None
Next: Initialize Firebase project and configure Google OAuth authentication

## Strategic Context

### Why This Matters

Medical documents are often complex and overwhelming for patients. MediInsight solves this by using AI to transform dense medical reports into clear, actionable insights that patients can understand and act upon. This empowers patients to better understand their health and have more informed conversations with their healthcare providers.

### Success Vision

Users can upload medical documents (PDFs, images) and receive AI-generated summaries, key insights, health status cards, medical timelines, and suggested questions for their doctors. The system provides a secure, user-friendly interface where patients can access their document analysis history and make sense of their medical information.

### Requirements (Discovered)

**Functional:**

- User can authenticate via Google OAuth using Firebase Auth
- User can upload medical documents (PDF, images) to Firebase Storage
- System extracts text from documents using Google Vision API (with Tesseract fallback)
- System analyzes extracted text using OpenAI GPT-4 to generate structured outputs
- User can view analysis results: summary, insights, health card, timeline, questions
- User can access history of previously analyzed documents
- System stores all data securely in PostgreSQL with proper user isolation and relational structure

**Non-Functional:**

- Performance: Document analysis within 30-60 seconds for typical documents
- Security: User data isolation, secure API key management, HTTPS only
- Scale: Support for individual users with personal document libraries

**Constraints:**

- Technical: Next.js 13 App Router, TypeScript, PostgreSQL + TypeORM, Firebase Auth only, Vercel deployment
- Business: MVP scope - single document analysis, no cross-document aggregation
- Team: Focus on core functionality, defer advanced features

### Architecture Decisions

- Pattern: Full-stack Next.js with API routes for unified codebase
- Stack: Next.js 13 + TypeScript + PostgreSQL + TypeORM + Firebase Auth + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS
- Trade-offs: Chose PostgreSQL + TypeORM for relational data modeling practice over NoSQL simplicity

- Performance: Test with realistic document sizes and user loads
- Security: Validate user data isolation and access controls
- Fixes: Address any issues discovered during integration testing

**Boundaries**:

- IN scope: End-to-end functionality, integration validation, critical bug fixes
- OUT scope: Advanced testing, performance optimization, feature enhancements
- Assumptions: Manual testing sufficient for MVP validation

**Risks**:

- Integration complexity: Systematic testing of all component interactions

**Research Confidence**: 80% (Integration testing patterns known, but system complexity requires thorough validation)
